## Mastering Cinematic Video on Foldable Phones

The large screens of foldable phones offer a significant advantage when shooting and reviewing video footage.  But fully utilizing this potential requires understanding key settings.

### Utilizing Pro Mode for Enhanced Control

The Pro mode on both the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold5 and Google Pixel Fold (2024) cameras provides granular control over ISO, shutter speed, white balance, and focus.  Mastering these settings allows for creative control and the ability to capture cinematic shots in challenging environments.  For example, a lower ISO will reduce grain in low-light scenarios, while a faster shutter speed will freeze motion.

### Exploring Different Video Formats and Resolutions

Experiment with different video formats like HEVC (H.265) to achieve higher quality videos with smaller file sizes.  Consider shooting in 4K resolution for maximum detail, especially if you plan on editing your videos later. The best camera phone for video, in 2025, will leverage these advancements.


## Achieving Stunning Low-Light Portraits

Low-light photography has historically been a challenge for mobile devices, but the latest foldable phones are pushing boundaries.

### Understanding Night Mode and its Settings

Night mode utilizes computational photography techniques to brighten dark scenes while maintaining detail and reducing noise.  Understanding how to adjust its settings, such as exposure and ISO, can dramatically improve the quality of your low-light shots.  Many budget 5G phones are now incorporating similar technology.

### Utilizing Portrait Mode for Professional Depth of Field

Portrait mode cleverly uses software algorithms to create a shallow depth of field, blurring the background and emphasizing your subject.  This technique is crucial for creating professional-looking portraits even in low-light conditions. The quality is even better on these top-tier devices.


## Harnessing the Unique Advantages of Foldable Form Factor

The foldable design provides unique opportunities for mobile photography.

### Utilizing the External Screen for Vlogging and Selfies

The external screen on these foldable phones is perfect for vlogging and selfies, enabling you to easily monitor your composition and framing.  This feature can significantly improve the ease and quality of self-produced content.

### Taking Advantage of the Larger Internal Screen for Editing and Reviewing

The large internal screen provides ample space for editing and reviewing your photos and videos. You can see more detail on the bigger canvas than a traditional smartphone.


## Advanced Post-Processing Techniques

Even with the best camera phone, some post-processing can significantly enhance your results.

### Utilizing Mobile Editing Apps for Enhanced Control

Many powerful mobile editing apps offer professional-level tools for color grading, sharpening, and noise reduction.  Experiment with different apps to find your preferred workflow.  iOS 18 features and Android 15 features will likely integrate even better with these apps in the future.


## Leveraging the Power of AI and Computational Photography

Both the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold5 and Google Pixel Fold (2024) leverage advanced AI and computational photography techniques to enhance image and video quality.

### Understanding AI Scene Detection and Enhancement

AI scene detection automatically optimizes camera settings for different shooting scenarios, ensuring you capture the best possible results with minimal manual adjustments.
